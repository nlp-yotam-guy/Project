abstract="This paper addresses the issue of simplifying natural language texts in order to ease the task of accessing factual information contained in them. We define the notion of Easy Access Sentence -- a unit of text from which the information it contains can be retrieved by a system with modest text-analysis capabilities, able to process single verb sentences with named entities as constituents. We present an algorithm that constructs Easy Access Sentences from the input text, with a small-scale evaluation. Challenges and further research directions are then discussed.",

abstract="We address the problem of simplifying Portuguese texts at the sentence level by treating it as a ``translation task''. We use the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) framework to learn how to translate from complex to simplified sentences. Given a parallel corpus of original and simplified texts, aligned at the sentence level, we train a standard SMT system and evaluate the ``translations'' produced using both standard SMT metrics like BLEU and manual inspection. Results are promising according to both evaluations, showing that while the model is usually overcautious in producing simplifications, the overall quality of the sentences is not degraded and certain types of simplification operations, mainly lexical, are appropriately captured.",
